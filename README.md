# People-in-Space
Shows you the current people in space and information about them

## About
This project is apart of an assignment from a JavaScript learning platform and meant to be used just as a portfolio asset. It is a review of AJAX, 
basic JavaScript, APIs, and Async code.

## Functionality
The website displays the current people in space and information about them along with a picture of each person after the user clicks the button 
that fires a XMLHttpRequest.

## How it works
People in Space pulls data from the [Open Notify API](http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json) about who is in space and pulls data from 
the [Wikimedia API](https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/summary/) using AJAX.
